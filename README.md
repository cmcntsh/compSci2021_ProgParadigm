# Programming Paradigms

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

Computer programming is a wide field. Not every computer program is created and run in the same way. There's often multiple ways to accomplish the same task using different programming paradigms. This week we'll be learning about different programming paradigms.
